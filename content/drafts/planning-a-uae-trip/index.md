# Local Morality

Apart from the ostentatious displays of wealth, the UAE is probably best known as a Muslim country with the laws that come along with that. Well, let's talk about that. No one will ever confuse this country with the Netherlands but on the other hand, it's not Saudi Arabia. Let's walk through a couple points of concern for many and see if we can't get a sense of what is and isn't acceptable.

## Dress

The most obvious concern for many will be dress. Most UAE locals wear [kanduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thawb) or [abayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya) with many women wearing the [niqab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niq%C4%81b) that many Westerners associate with Islamic dress. Although the locals dress this way, you shouldn't feel the need to match this level of dress. Many expats and foreigners regularly dress more similarly to what we're used to in the West, with plenty of jeans and shorts and t shirts. Most male dress is acceptable (with the exception of in a couple of places which I'll cover later) including shorts. Women similarly should find the dress code reasonable with the caveat that this is not the place to show a lot of skin. Reasonable length shorts and t-shirts are completely fine. The dress for theme parks more or less follows this. I saw plenty of people dressed very Western in the parks and you shouldn't let it scare you away from visiting!

And then there are more formal places like mosques. If you visit a mosque in the UAE, then you must be more modest. Men need to cover their shoulders and cannot wear shorts. Women must do the same and in addition must wear a head scarf. Luckily, if you are visiting and don't have the appropriate attires, most mosques that give tours will lend you local attire to wear.

## Cohabitation

It is illegal to stay in a hotel room with another member of the opposite sex unless you are married to them or they are a close family member. With that being said, most hotels don't care. The only issue you'll run into is if anyone complains at which point the police will get involved. TL;DR, as long as you keep it to yourself, it probably won't be a big deal.
